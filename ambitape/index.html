<p>AmbiTape is companion software for the <a href="/blinkytape">BlinkyTape</a>.  It allows you
to add real-time ambient backlighting effects to your computer monitor.  This
effect can make it seem like the image on your monitor extends outside of the
frame on the screen.  We think it looks pretty cool!</p>

<p>AmbiTape is based on Adafruit's <a href="http://learn.adafruit.com/adalight-diy-ambient-tv-lighting/overview">Adalight</a>
software, which uses <a href="http://processing.org/download/">Processing</a> to capture
colors from different regions of your screen and send them out to the LEDs via
USB.  Adalight, in turn, is inspired by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambilight">Ambilight</a>
feature of Philips' LCD HDTVs.</p>

<p>This entire project can be done in as little as 30 minutes!</p>

<!-- # Downloading and Using The AmbiTape Software

## Prerequisites

You'll need to download and install [Processing 1.5.1](http://processing.org/download/). It is untested in Processing 2.0.

AmbiTape comes in the `examples` folder of the [BlinkyTape source repository](https://github.com/blinkiverse/BlinkyTape/) on Github.

If you have Git installed, you can grab the `BlinkyTape` repository with:

    $ git clone git://github.com/blinkiverse/BlinkyTape.git

If you don't have Git installed, you can download the [BlinkyTape repository as a zip file](https://github.com/blinkiverse/BlinkyTape/archive/master.zip). -->


<h2>Install Processing</h2>

<p>The Processing development environment runs in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.</p>

<p>BlinkyTape is known to work with Processing version 2.0.2.</p>

<p>You can find downloads and detailed install instructions for your platform on
the <a href="http://processing.org/tutorials/gettingstarted/">Processing Getting Started page</a>.</p>

<h2>Install the BlinkyTape Processing Libraries</h2>

<p>Now that you have downloaded Processing, it's time to download some helper code and examples. This stuff lets us make our programs a bit more simply than if we had to do everything from scratch, as you'll see later on.</p>

<h3>Get it.</h3>

<p>Here is the link to <a href="https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape_Processing">what we want</a>. This is a live GitHub repository, so it should always be up to date. Use the <em>"Download ZIP"</em> link on the right of the page.<!--- we'll have to change this when there's a different download link ---></p>

<h3>Install it</h3>

<p>Unzip this folder in your Processing libraries folder - this is located at <code>Documents/Processing/libraries</code> on Mac or <code>My Documents\Processing\libraries</code> on Windows.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> When you unzip the file, the resulting folder will probably be called something like <code>BlinkyTape_Processing-master</code> -- delete everything after the underscore, or Processing won't import the library. (It doesn't like special characters.)</p>

<h2>Install the ControlP5 library</h2>

<p>The last step before firing up PatternPaint is to install a Processing library
called "ControlP5." This helps us draw interface elements.</p>

<p>Luckily, Processing 2 has a way to easily install ControlP5 without
downloading it separately. In Processing, open the <strong>Sketch</strong> menu, followed by
<strong>Import Library</strong>, then <strong>Add Library</strong>.  A new <strong>Library Manager</strong> window will
appear. In the "<em>Filter your search...</em>" box, type in 'controlp5' and click the
ControlP5 item that appears to install it.</p>

<p>If you have any trouble, <a href="http://processing.org/reference/libraries/">here's some more info about libraries for
Processing</a> including <a href="http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library">instructions
for manually installing libraries</a>.
If you need to install it manually, you can download ControlP5 from <a href="http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/">the
ControlP5 home page</a>.</p>

<h2>Restart Processing, if it is running.</h2>

<p>You should now see the BlinkyTape examples if you go to <strong>File | Examples</strong>. This will open a chooser-type window so you can scroll through all of your installed examples for Processing.  You'll find ours in <strong>Contributed Libraries | BlinkyTape</strong>.</p>

<h2>Starting AmbiTape</h2>

<ol>
<li>Connect your BlinkyTape to your computer via USB</li>
<li>Open the AmbiTape sketch in Processing

<ul>
<li>Find it at <code>BlinkyTape/examples/AmbiTape/AmbiTape.pde</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the Run button.</li>
</ol>


<p>Your BlinkyTape should light up, projecting colors from your display!</p>

<hr />

<p><a name="mounting"></a></p>

<h1>Mounting The BlinkyTape</h1>

<h2>The "Drape" Method (Estimated Time: 5 minutes)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-draped.jpg" alt="BlinkyTape attached to outside of monitor with clear tape" /></p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Easy to install. Easy to remove.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Projects light out to the sides rather than back against the
wall, reducing the effect.</p>

<p>This method is simplest, though the results are not as pretty as with the other
methods described below.</p>

<p>Simply drape the BlinkyTape over the top of your display.  You can crease the
edges slightly to help everything stay down.  Clear tape or double-sided tape
should be enough to keep it in place.  You may want to remove the BlinkyTape
from its silicone tubing if the sides don't want to stay down.</p>

<h2>The "Twist" Method (Preferred.  Estimated Time: 10 minutes)</h2>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-twisted.jpg" alt="Twisted BlinkyTape attached to back of monitor w/ double sided tape" /></p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Easy to install.  Easy to remove.  Projects light against the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Requires creasing the BlinkyTape.  Results in a "dead" pixel at
each turn due to pixels pointing in toward the monitor.</p>

<p>The backlighting effect works much better when the LEDs are projecting directly
against a wall.  With a little BlinkyTape folding (Blinkigami), we can get the
BlinkyTape into a rectangular shape that lies flat.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-twist-closeup.jpg" alt="BlinkyTape folded to make a 90&deg; turn" /></p>

<p>Here is an image of the BlinkyTape, folded over so it makes a 90&deg; turn, with
all visible LEDs facing the same direction. The silicone tubing has been removed
to make it easier to fold and mount the BlinkyTape.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-twist-back.jpg" alt="BlinkyTape 90&deg; fold, back side view" /></p>

<p>This image shows the fold from the back, which might give a better idea of how
the fold is done.  This image shows the "sacrificial" LED, which will be facing
in towards the monitor.  We'll <a href="#mapping">configure</a> the AmbiTape software to
ignore this LED later.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-twisted.jpg" alt="Folded BlinkyTape, attached to monitor with double-sided tape" /></p>

<p>Here is an image of the complete installation.  The folded BlinkyTape is
attached to the back of the monitor using double-sided sticky tape.</p>

<h2>The "Hardcore" Method (Estimated Time: Hours)</h2>

<p>Unless you have a very small monitor, the BlinkyTape is probably not long enough
to completely cover each edge along the back of your monitor.</p>

<p>However, it is <em>totally</em> possible to spread out the BlinkyTape's 60 RGB LED
pixels to cover your monitor, no matter how large it is!</p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>: Projects light against the wall.  Fully covers the perimeter of
your screen.</p>

<p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>: Requires cutting and reassembling the BlinkyTape.  This is not
easy to undo once it is done!</p>

<p>Because we favor quick hacks and reusability, we haven't carried out this method
ourselves, but we have some hints for those that want to try it out.</p>

<h3>What You'll Need</h3>

<ul>
<li>BlinkyTape</li>
<li>Wire cutters or other tool capable of cutting the BlinkyTape's flexible backing.</li>
<li>3 colors of stranded wire (14ga should be fine).</li>
<li>A soldering iron and solder.</li>
</ul>


<h3>The Process</h3>

<!---
![Cut the BlinkyTape in the space between the solder pads]()
-->


<ol>
<li>Remove the BlinkyTape from its silicone tube.</li>
<li>Cut the BlinkyTape into the appropriate number of segments for your setup.

<ul>
<li>Try to cut exactly between the solder pads in between pixels. See the
photo above for help.</li>
<li>Make sure you <strong>don't</strong> cut the BlinkyBoard off the end!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cut your stranded wires into the appropriate lengths to create "jumpers"
between each segment of BlinkyTape.</li>
<li>Solder your tape back together with the jumper wires in between.

<ul>
<li>Make sure to begin with the segment that has the BlinkyBoard attached!</li>
<li>The order of the power, ground, and signal pins matters, so make sure all
of the text is facing the same way!</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<h3>Determining Appropriate Segment Sizes and Wire Lengths</h3>

<p>The correct size and number of segments is going to vary widely based on your
screen size, how you want to mount the LEDs, and your personal preferences.</p>

<p>Start by determining the number of "clusters" you want to place. If you're not
afraid to spend a good deal of time soldering, you can cut your BlinkyTape into
many small segments (e.g. 20 segments of 3 pixels each, 12 segments of 5 pixels
each, etc.).  This step determines how many sets of jumpers you will have to
cut and solder.  For example, 20 segments requires 19 sets of jumper wires.</p>

<p>Next, measure out the perimeter along the back of your screen that you intend to
cover.  This can be as simple as measuring the width and height of your monitor
where you intend to mount the LEDs, adding up both numbers, and multiplying by
two.</p>

<p>Finally, determine how long each set of jumper wires should be.  This can be a
pretty simple equation like:</p>

<pre><code>jumper_length = (perimeter - 100cm) / number_of_jumpers
</code></pre>

<p>You will probably want slightly different lengths for any sets of jumpers that
have to turn a corner, in order to help the wires lay flat.</p>

<h2>Configuring AmbiTape for your Display (Estimated Time: 20 minutes)</h2>

<p>Each AmbiTape installation is different and depends on the size of your monitor
and your mounting method.  To get the best lighting effects with AmbiTape,
you'll need to tell AmbiLight how to map each pixel to a particular region on
your display.</p>

<p>For the time being, with our apologies, this is a manual process and requires a
bit of thought.  You will need to edit <code>AmbiTape.pde</code> to match your setup.</p>

<h3>Update the <code>displays</code> array</h3>

<p>AmbiTape breaks your screen down into a small number of regions.  You can think
of this as a tiny "virtual screen", where each block along an edge corresponds
to an LED.</p>

<p>Below is an example <code>display</code> array for a 19" monitor with a 4:3 aspect ratio:</p>

<pre><code>static final int displays[][] = new int[][] {
   {0,26,20} // Screen 0, 26 LEDs across, 20 LEDs down
};
</code></pre>

<p>You may notice that the BlinkyTape's 60 LEDs does not come close to covering the
<code>2 * (26 + 20) = 92</code> pixels described here.  In this setup, the BlinkyTape
covers the top edge of the screen and most of the left and right sides.  The
particulars of this are handled below.</p>

<h3>Update the <code>leds</code> array</h3>

<p><img src="/images/ambitape/big/ambitape-mapping.png" alt="AmbiTape preview of LED mapping" /></p>

<p>To determine which pixel corresponds to which region on the screen, the <code>leds</code>
array lists a screen coordinate for each pixel in the BlinkyTape, starting with
the LED that is attached to the BlinkyBoard.</p>

<p>Here is an example <code>leds</code> array for the 19" monitor described above. Note the
two "dead" pixels that are assigned to screen <code>-1</code>. This indicates to AmbiTape
that it should leave those pixels black rather than lighting them up.</p>

<pre><code>static final int leds[][] = new int[][] {
    // Left Side
    {0,0,17}, {0,0,16}, {0,0,15}, {0,0,14}, {0,0,13}, {0,0,12},
    {0,0,11}, {0,0,10}, {0,0, 9}, {0,0, 8}, {0,0, 7}, {0,0, 6},
    {0,0, 5}, {0,0, 4}, {0,0, 3}, {0,0, 2}, {0,0, 1},

    // Top Side - "dead" pixels indicated with a -1
    {-1,0, 1}, {0, 1,1}, {0, 2,1}, {0, 3,1}, {0, 4,1}, {0, 5,1},
    {0, 6,1}, {0, 7,1}, {0, 8,1}, {0, 9,1}, {0,10,1}, {0,11,1},
    {0,12,1}, {0,13,1}, {0,14,1}, {0,15,1}, {0,16,1}, {0,17,1},
    {0,18,1}, {0,19,1}, {0,20,1}, {0,21,1}, {0,22,1}, {0,23,1},
    {0,24,1}, {-1,25,1},

    // Right Side
    {0,25, 1}, {0,25, 2}, {0,25, 3}, {0,25, 4}, {0,25, 5}, {0,25, 6},
    {0,25, 7}, {0,25, 8}, {0,25, 9}, {0,25,10}, {0,25,11}, {0,25,12},
    {0,25,13}, {0,25,14}, {0,25,15}, {0,25,16}, {0,25,17}
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Further Notes on Configuration</h2>

<p>Every display and application can be a bit different, so expect to play with
the configuration as you go.  Some things to watch out for:</p>

<p><strong>Black Bars</strong></p>

<p>Many movie players end up adding black bars to the top/bottom or left/right
sides of a display when the video's aspect ratio doesn't match up with the
display's.</p>

<p>One way to work around this is to update your configuration to pull colors
from closer to the center of the display.</p>

<p><strong>OS X Menu Bar</strong></p>

<p>The OS X menu bar is shown almost all the time, and is almost uniformly bright
white.  This makes for a pretty uninteresting backlight display!  A simple fix
is, as with the black bars, to adjust your configuration to pull colors from
a bit lower than the top row of pixels.  In the <code>leds</code> example, above, the top
row of LEDs get their color from the <code>Y = 1</code> row, rather than the <code>Y = 0</code> row.</p>
