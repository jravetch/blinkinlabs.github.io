# BlinkyTape Developer Early Revision Program (BT-DERP)

This page contains the description and terms for the BlinkyTape
Developer Early Revision Program (BT-DERP).

**Applications are now closed. Thank you all so much!**

## What is it?

The BT-DERP is a program to get pre-production BlinkyTapes into the hands of
adventurous developers and designers who want to help us make the BlinkyTape
awesome!

Program members will create and share awesome new projects,
libraries, documentation, and more with the BlinkyTape community.

## What Do I Get?

Developers who are accepted into the BT-DERP will receive:

**A pre-production BlinkyTape shipped in late August**! Your pre-production
BlinkyTape will come with no accessories. Pre-production units are not as
polished as production units and may be more fragile. We cannot replace one if
it is broken or does not work. (*You will still receive your production BlinkyTape and accessories when they are ready!*)

**Developer support via email and instant messaging from the BlinkyTape developers!**

**You will be featured as a Beta Developer on our site and in our documentation.**

**Your progress updates will be featured in our KS backer updates.**

**We'll feature the best projects at our booth at MakerFaire NYC 2013.** See details below.

## Who Can Apply?

The BT-DERP is open to our US Kickstarter backers who pledged at the $50 level
or above.  In other words, anyone who is scheduled to receive a production BlinkyTape.
We will be using your email address to confirm your Kickstarter pledge, so
please make sure that your application includes the same email address you used
when you backed BlinkyTape on Kickstarter!

Unfortunately, due to shipping costs and time constraints, we can only accept
BT-DERP applications from residents of the lower 48 United States.

## What Will I Make?

That is up to you! We want these early units to go out to people who are going
to make and share things that other BlinkyTape owners can use, learn from, and
expand upon.

Some examples:

* Awesome new HowTos
* New open source apps to run on or with the BlinkyTape
* BlinkyTape libraries for your favorite langauge or platform?
	* Lua? node.js? Websockets???
* Sweet data visualizations
* Bike accessories
* Control a BlinkyTape with a Raspberry Pi
* Hook up a microphone or accelerometer to a BlinkyTape
* Something completely different!

## What Will I Need To Do?

**Keep in touch!**

We'll set up a BT-DERP mailing list for general discussion and support. We also
want to share your progress with the 1000+ BlinkyTape backers on Kickstarter, so
in-progress photos and write-ups will be encouraged every week.

**Document Everything**

The coolest program is not useful if it can't be understood and a HowTo is no
good without the "How To" bits.

We'll work with accepted developers to figure out what exact documentation makes
sense for their project, but here are some ideas of what to expect:

* Every project needs a cool "demo shot" like a short video, animated gif, or Vine.
* Hardware projects will need
	* a bill of materials
	* assembly instructions with pictures
	* source files and instructions for any printed/CNC/lasercut parts
* Software apps will need
	* Instructions for acquiring and running the software
	* Instructions for common uses of the software
	* Instructions for developers
* Libraries will need
	* Instructions for developers
	* Some documented "Hello World" examples using your library

**Open Source Your Files**

We believe in the power of open source. We want to see you get credit for your
work and see as many people as possible benefit from it!

If you're accepted into the program, you agree to license your source code and
hardware design files for your project under an open source license. For example,
one of the licenses listed at [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/).

You also agree to license your documentation, images, and videos for the project
under a [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/choose/).

We encourage you to choose a license that requires attribution. A share-alike
license is great, as well!

Because BlinkyTape is a commercial product, was ask that you choose a license
that allows commercial use.

**Share Your Project (Fast)!**

We're planning to ship the BlinkyTape in late September 2013. In order to
benefit the first BlinkyTape recipients, developers will need to post completed
project files and documentation by **September 30, 2013**.

As a bonus for speedy developers - we'll also feature the best projects at our
booth at [MakerFaire NYC 2013](http://makerfaire.com/new-york-2013/) on
**September 21-22, 2013**!
