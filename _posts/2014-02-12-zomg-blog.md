O hai.

We just realized that most normal internet-type organizations have, like a place where we can...like...put updates and news.  And stuff.

So we're going to do that.

So...yeah...we probably should have had one of these for a long time now, but we we made a lot of use from the blog functionality of our [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/740956622/blinkytape-the-led-strip-reinvented) and it just didn't seem like that big a deal, since a most of our communications centered there.

But now things have changed - we've completed fulfillment for our Kickstarter ([be in touch](mailto:support@blinkinlabs.com) if you're still waiting) and now we're starting to move on to new and exciting things.  So, we need a place to put them.

Here.

You heard it here first, folks!  Now go tell your friends...

In other news, I apologize for making such a silly post.
