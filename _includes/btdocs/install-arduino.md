## Install Arduino

Our first step is to download the Arduino development environment. We made Blinkytape compatible with Arduino because it has a huge community and runs in Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux -- so, chances are good that you'll be able to run it on your computer and also find help if you get stuck anywhere.

The fine folks at Arduino have this covered very well, so head over to the [Arduino Getting Started page](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) for detailed install instructions. The installation process is very straightforward and they have [good documentation](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) if you have any trouble.

If you're having trouble picking a version, BlinkyTape is known to work with Arduino version 1.0.5.

### A note on drivers
If you're using Windows, you'll need the drivers for both BlinkyTape and Arduino before you can program your tape this way. Make sure that you install the [PatternPaint package](/software/patternpaint/) which includes the Blinkytape driver, and also the drivers for Arduino which are included in the Arduino package. Windows uses two slightly different drivers depending on how the tape identifies itself, but if you have both, you'll be OK in all scenarios.
