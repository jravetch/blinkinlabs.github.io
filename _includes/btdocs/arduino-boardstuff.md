## Special Stuff for Uber-pros
So, you  might have noticed that we've been asking your BlinkyTape to pretend that it's an Arduino Leonardo. That's totally fine, since we've made sure that all of our software will work when that's the case.  However...there's a little more to the story. There's an additional github repository, [which you can find here,](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/Blinkinlabs32u4_boards) that contains the code to let your BlinkyTape think it's still a Blinkytape.  You shouldn't need to do this, but if you're flashing a BlinkyTape for a friend who runs Windows and doesn't have Arduino installed, you might want to grab these files. Just make a folder called `hardware` in your documents/Arduino folder and drop the files in there.

There's also some interesting stuff in [this Github repository](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/BlinkyTape) -- this contains the actual ProductionSketch, as well as the physical designs for the PCB boards, in case all of this programming stuff is just a little too virtual for you!
