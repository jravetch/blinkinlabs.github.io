# Downloading PatternPaint
Thanks to our programmers (OK, just Matt) working around the clock, PatternPaint now comes in a handy-dandy pre-packaged distribution, so you can get up and running in minutes.

**Get it here: [PatternPaint Releases](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs/PatternPaint/releases)**

There are versions here for both Windows and OS X.  The Windows installer also **includes the drivers you'll need.**  (Not necessary on other operating systems.) On Windows, just run the installer after it's downloaded and follow the prompts.  On OS X, open the `.dmg` and drag PatternPaint into your Applications folder.
