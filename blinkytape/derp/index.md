# BlinkyTape Developer Early Revision Program (BT-DERP)

The BT-DERP is a program to get pre-production BlinkyTapes into the hands of
adventurous developers and designers who want to help us make the BlinkyTape
awesome!

Program members are creating and sharing awesome new projects,
libraries, documentation, and more with the BlinkyTape community!

# Meet the BT-DERP Developers!

## Gladys Delgado-garced

A certified pet fashion designer by the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York,
Gladys is the owner of the [Doggone Couture](http://www.yelp.com/biz/doggone-couture-philadelphia)
pet store in Philadelphia, PA. She is [no stranger](http://fashionista.com/2013/05/inside-fits-doggie-fashion-show/dsc_0187-cropped-2/) to wearable LEDs.

Gladys will be putting a BlinkyTape to work in the challenging world of doggy
fashion. We think she will have some great advice for folks who want to use
BlinkyTape in their own wearable projects!

## Ethan Hartman

Ethan is a jack-of-all trades with training in interfaces for musical expression from Stanford's CCRMA. He's super excited about making things blink.

His project is to make sure that Blinkytape is ready to accept [OSC](http://opensoundcontrol.org/) messages, so it's easy to use things like [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/products/max/) and [Puredata](http://puredata.info/) to make things pulse along with your musical projects.

## Matt Todd

Matt says:

> I'm a web developer working at GitHub in San Francisco. In my free time, I build interactive music and visualizations using Max/MSP.

> I'm adding a physical component to my visualizations, bridging the gap between Max/MSP and Ruby and these lights to programmatically control supplemental lighting.

## Jordan Berry

Jordan has been building light art for eight years now, starting from humble beginnings ([a hat with *25 feet of various colored EL wire* sewn in to it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDqnY085m4U)). 

Jordan will be using his BlinkyTape to improve on his friend Zao Naegle's design
for a *five to six foot wizard staff* with a BlinkyTape-illuminated orb.

## Mark Kriegsman

![Mark!](/images/{{page.img}}/devs/mark.jpg)

[Mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kriegsman) is co-author (with Daniel Garcia) of the popular open source "FastSPI" LED library.  Mark creates his own LED artworks as well as teaching an LED programming class in order to, as he says "Let a thousand pixels bloom."  He has founded three companies, holds several patents, and has been publishing his code as open source software since a surprisingly long time ago.

Mark is building a color-calibration profile for the BlinkyTape, so that others can have better, more predictable control over exactly the colors they display on their BlinkyTape.   Mark also hopes to migrate this LED color-calibration code back into the FastSPI LED library's general open source color handling routines.
