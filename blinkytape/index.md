![Meet BlinkyTape](/images/blinkytape/bt-splash.jpg)

First off, welcome! This is good stuff.  We've had a blast making BlinkyTape, and we're real glad you're here.  BlinkyTape is a community project, and we really need people like you in order to continue the awesomization of LED strips everywhere.

# Sign Up to be Notified when the BlinkyTape is Available for Purchase

We're busily manufacturing the first BlinkyTapes for our Kickstarter Backers.  After that, we plan to make the BlinkyTape available for purchase via distributors online.

# [What the Heck is a BlinkyTape?](/blinkytape/about)

BlinkyTape is a super-cool LED strip with full-color RGB LEDs and an integrated microcontroller. We created [BlinkyTape](/blinkytape/about/) in order to make LEDs easier to use. A big part of this was making sure that it's easy to make programs that will talk to BlinkyTape. *But* -- and this is a big but -- you *don't* need to program in order to make your BlinkyTape do awesome stuff.

# [What's the first thing I should do with BlinkyTape? OR let's make things blink without programming!](/software/patternpaint/)

Great, let's get up to speed.  First let's install [PatternPaint](/software/patternpaint/) <!--- change to the docs version of patternpaint when it's ready --->which is designed to help you animate your BlinkyTape with a simple visual editor. PatternPaint is especially super for making patterns in long-exposure photography or [persistence of vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) but it's also good for just making cool stuff happen on your BlinkyTape strip.

**Windows users: this package also contains the drivers, so you need to start [here!!](/software/patternpaint/)**  

Other platforms don't need special drivers, but we still recommend checking out PatternPaint.

We also hope to showcase cool community projects here, and we have a few examples to get you going, so check out [BlinkyTile](/blinkytile), [AmbiTape](/ambitape) and [DiscoParty](/software/discoparty/) - all these are extremely cool, in our opintion, but we're looking forward to even cooler stuff coming from the community.

# [OK! I want to make my own programs that talk to BlinkyTape, because I have some AMAZING ideas.](/blinkytape/docs/processing/)

Fantastic - we can't wait until we see your brain-contents playing back on a BlinkyTape! That might not have come out right...but don't worry, we've made the 'tapes easy to program. Like we said before, we're super-duper excited about what the community comes up with. So far, we've been doing most of our programming in [Processing](http://processing.org/). You might have already grabbed that in order to play with PatternPaint, but if not, we'd suggest you go ahead and do that now. And if Processing isn't your thing, that's OK! The community has already done some work in other languages. You'll find more info about this path by following [THIS LINK RIGHT HERE!](/blinkytape/docs/processing/)

# [That's cool, but I want to get right down and change the program that runs on the BlinkyTape!](/blinkytape/docs/arduino)

You're right: this *is* cool too.  The BlinkyBoard (which, [as you might know already](/blinkytape/about/), is the heart and soul of your BlinkyTape) is very similar to an [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) and you can use the [Arduino environment](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to program it. Of course, there are a few other details that you'll want to know about, and you'll find this information [RIGHT HERE](/blinkytape/docs/arduino/)

<!--- I'd usually end by asking for feedback - are you guys getting lots of emails about this? --->
