![Meet BlinkyTape](/images/blinkytape/big/bt_splash.jpg)

First off, welcome! This is good stuff.  We've had a blast making BlinkyTape, and we're real glad you're here.  BlinkyTape is a community project, and we really need people like you in order to continue the awesomization of LED strips everywhere.

# BlinkyTape is for Sale Now!

We're very pleased to say that you can now find BlinkyTape for sale at[ Adafruit Industries](http://www.adafruit.com/product/1605) and [Seeed Studio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/blinkytape-basic-p-1679.html).

# [What the Heck is a BlinkyTape?](/blinkytape/about)

BlinkyTape is a super-cool LED strip with full-color RGB LEDs and an integrated microcontroller. We created [BlinkyTape](/blinkytape/about/) in order to make LEDs easier to use. A big part of this was making sure that it's easy to make programs that will talk to BlinkyTape. *But* -- and this is a big but -- you *don't* need to program in order to make your BlinkyTape do awesome stuff.

# Phase One: Get your BlinkyTape up and running with [PatternPaint](/software/patternpaint/)!

[![PatternPaint](/images/blinkytape/big/patternQT.png)](/software/patternpaint/)

Great, let's get up to speed -- let's install [PatternPaint](/software/patternpaint/) <!--- change to the docs version of patternpaint when it's ready --->, a custom software program which is designed to help you animate your BlinkyTape with a simple visual editor. PatternPaint is especially super for making patterns in long-exposure photography or [persistence of vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision) but it's also good for just making cool stuff happen on your BlinkyTape strip.

**Windows users: this package also contains the drivers, so you need to start [here!!](/software/patternpaint/)**  

Other platforms don't need special drivers, but PatternPaint is still a great way to start your BlinkyTape experience.

We also hope to showcase cool community projects here, and we have a few examples to get you going, so check out [BlinkyTile](/blinkytile/), [AmbiTape](/ambitape/) and [DiscoParty](/software/discoparty/) - all these are extremely cool, in our opintion, but we're looking forward to even cooler stuff coming from the community.

# Phase Two: Program your own amazing project using [Arduino](/blinkytape/docs/arduino/) or [Processing](/blinkytape/docs/processing/).

![Programming!](/images/blinkytape/big/programming.png)

Fantastic - as we said, we're super-duper excited about what the community comes up with. So far, we've been doing most of our programming in the [Arduino environment](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) or [Processing](http://processing.org/).  Processing is great for projects where your BlinkyTape is hooked up to a computer - [head over here](/blinkytape/docs/processing/) for more info on how to get started down that road.

If you're interested in making a new stand-along BlinkyTape program, you probably want to create a new sketch using Arduino. Check that out [over here](/blinkytape/docs/arduino/).

Or you can just jump over to the [Blinkinlabs Github](https://github.com/Blinkinlabs) to get your hands dirty right away. There are even some examples in other languages like Perl and Python!
