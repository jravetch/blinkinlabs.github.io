title: Programming for Blinkytape using languages like Processing
---
OK, so you want to make a program that runs on your computer and sends instructions to your BlinkyTape? That's fabulous, and you're in the right place. (If that's not you, sorry, you're going to have find training techniques for [canine agility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_agility) somewhere else.)

The easiest platform to program for BlinkyTape is called [Processing](http://processing.org/), which is a special language and development environment intended for visual art largely based on Java. It's what the BlinkyTape team used to make [PatternPaint](/software/PatternPaint/), so we can definitely help you get started.
